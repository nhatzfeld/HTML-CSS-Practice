                <p>I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom
                    in the history of our nation</p>
                <p>Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, sign the Emancipation Proclamation.
                    This momentous decree came as a great beacon life of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared
                    in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity</p>
